## Data Summary

The original data was obtained from http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones.

There are `r ncol(finalData)` variables in the final data set. Each subject (30 of them) undertook six activities which therefore provides 6 x 30 = `r 6*30` rows.

The first 5 rows are provided in the following table.

```{r}
head(finalData,5)
```


## Unit of Measure

The original units are compiled from normalised z-scores (min = -1 and max = 1) this can be demonstrated by using the `summary` function on the original data set. 

The final dataset provides the mean value of these scores. The class of variables is integer for `subject`, character for 'activity' and numeric for all remaining variables.

## Variables

All variables for the final data set are provided below.

```{r echo=TRUE}
    names(finalData)
```
